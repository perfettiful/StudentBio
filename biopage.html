                My name is Nathan Perfetti and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I studied Statistics at U of MN, Morris graduating in '16. Since college, I've worked mostly in E-Commerce management. Speaking from experience, there are some seriously junk E-Comm sites out there that make their content management a teeth-pulling struggle and even the big players (I'm talkin' Amazon, ebay, Walmart.com) are no exception. :joy: I hope to turn my experience around and learn the principles of good web design (both aesthetic and functional) in this program with all of you!

Follow me on Github ( https://github.com/perfettiful ), on Twiiter ( https://twitter.com/nateperfetti ), and let's get this road on the show!
